    "# Pythagorean Expectation and English Soccer\n",
    "\n",
    "In soccer, teams score goals, and we can calculate Pythagorean Expectations based on goals scored and goals conceded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of competition in soccer in most countries around the world is different from the sports we have looked at so far. Rather than leagues operating as independent entities, they are connected through a hierarchical system, sometimes called \"the pyramid\". In England, the English Premier League is at the top of the pyramid (it used to be called the First Division) and contains 20 teams. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beneath the Premier League is The Football League Championship (it used to be called Division Two) and it contains 24 teams. The Premier League and the Championship are linked via the system of promotion and relegation. At the end of each season, the three worst performing teams (measured by points won in competition) are relegated to play Championship soccer in the following season, to be replaced by the three best performing teams in the Championship. Beneath the Championship are two more leagues - League One (formerly Third Division) and League Two (formerly Fourth Division). These leagues are also linked, hierarchically, through promotion and relegation. Thus it makes sense to think of these four divisions as part of a common system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In any one season, there are 92 teams in the system. Even though teams compete in different divisions, we can define both win percentage and Pythagorean Expectation for each team, in order to see how well the data fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of the four divisions, every team plays every other team twice in a season, once at home and once away. There is no playoff, so the champion is the team at the end of the season with the largest number of points (3 points for a win, one for a draw (tie)). Unlike the leagues we have looked at so far, draws are not only possible but are quite common. We need to adjust our definition of win percentage for this case. We could create a statistic such as the percentage of maximum possible points, but instead, we do something simpler- we give a value of 1 for a win, 0 for a loss, and 1/2 for a draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now follow the same procedure we have used to date."
