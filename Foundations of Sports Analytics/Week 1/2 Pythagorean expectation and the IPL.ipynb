    "# Pythagorean Expectation and the Indian Premier League\n",
    "\n",
    "The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest cricket competition in the world, which has all of the world's best players in an eight week tournament involving eight teams playing sixty games in total. Each team plays every other team, once at home and then away, and the competition finishes with the four best teams competing in semi-finals and then a final.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cricket, like baseball, is a bat and ball game, where teams score runs and the team scoring the highest number of runs is the winner. There are, of course, many differences, but statistically speaking, we can generate the same Pythagorean statistic that we generated for baseball. Our data here is derived from the competition that took place in 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPL is played in the T20 format, in which each team has up to 120 balls to score as many runs as they can (the game takes less than three hours to complete). One difference from baseball is that runs are much easier to score - in the IPL an average score is 170 runs - and outs (wickets) are much more costly - each team has only ten outs(called wickets) in the entire game, and if you run out of wickets before the 120 balls have been bowled (pitched) then your inning is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this background, let's construct the Pythagorean Expectation for the IPL in 2018."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Why did the Pythagorean model produce a good fit for the baseball data but not for the cricket data? An obvious explanation is that there is some difference between the two sports which makes the model appropriate for one but not the other. For example, in cricket, the team batting second need only score one more run than the opponent to win, and so the inning ends if it reaches this milestone. If the team batting second is the winning team, then the gap in the scores will be small. However, if the team batting first can get all ten wickets cheaply, then the gap in scores could be very large. In our data the average runs difference when the team batting second won was 2, and when the team batting first won was 30. This might explain why the Pythagorean Expectation is not a good guide to winning in the IPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there could be more basic statistical explanations. For MLB we had averages for 30 teams, each of which played about 160 games. Random variations are likely to be smoothed out when analyzing data on this scale. For the IPL we had only 8 teams, most of whom played only 14 games - so there is a much greater chance that random variations could have overwhelmed the Pythagorean model if it were correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone interested in pursuing this further, might try two things. First, analyze games where the winning team bats first or second separately. Second, find data covering more seasons (not difficult to find online) in order to generate a much larger sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, however, we are going to move on and look at another sport: basketball.\n",
